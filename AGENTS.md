Kids certification is warmed in the background after playlist loading and cached locally/cloud-side so profiles remain responsive.
- Cloud sync is tied to an email/password account: the authenticated user id is the sync key and row-level rules restrict every row to its owner.
- The native application identity is StellarTV on every platform; Dart and native player bridge names change together.
- TV presentation is capability-gated through the native Android UI mode; touch layouts and behavior remain the unchanged default.
- TV category panels share one remote-only drawer implementation with geometric left-edge detection and explicit focus restoration, to avoid trapping navigation across catalog tabs.
- TV player controls use a dedicated play focus anchor and leave button activation to the focused control, so showing controls never traverses back into the video surface.

- Playlist sections download in a background isolate with a streaming JSON parser (truncation-tolerant, bounded timeouts), run one at a time through a shared queue, publish and cache per section, and can be retried individually; pages are wrapped by a shared section frame that shows real progress, retry and saved-copy states on touch and TV, so huge playlists never block the UI or reload unrelated sections.
